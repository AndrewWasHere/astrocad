# AstroCAD

3D-printable CAD designs for astronomy.

Use [OpenSCAD](https://openscad.org) to modify and export an STL file, then
slice the STL file with your favorite slicer, and print with your favorite
3D printer.

Alternatively, modify the .scad file in your favorite text editor, and use
OpenSCAD from the command line to create the STL file, bypassing the GUI.

```
openscad -o <output_filename>.stl <input_filename>.scad
```

See README.md files in the project subdirectories for descriptions of the
CAD files.
