custom focusing mask.

The Bahtinov Mask is a very popular focusing aid for astrophotography.

## Hartmann Mask

For a description of the Hartmann Mask, see Wikipedia:

The Hartmann mask is considered inferior to the Bahtinov Mask, but it's a 
heckuva lot easier to create than any of the other focusing masks here. And if
you make the holes triangular, you get diffraction spikes to aid in focusing.

## Y Mask

A Bahtinov Mask, simplified.

See the Cloudy Nights forum thread linked in the Bahtinov Mask section.

The Y Mask is supposed to give similar results to the Bahtinov Mask, while
allowing more light to pass through.
